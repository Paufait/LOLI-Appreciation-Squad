		<h2>What is Streetwear?</h2>
		<p class="brand_para">
		Streetwear is a style of fashion generally connected to urban areas and youth culture. Originally from Californian surfing and skating culture, the style eventually began mixing with hip hop culture, Japanese street fashion and high end French style. 
		<br><br>
		During the late 1900’s, streetwear was worn with hip hop and skate influence. Pieces were often bold, colourful and filled with retro-styled logos. High-top designed shoes were classics during the times. As the 2000’s rolled around, punk rock style became more apparent and influenced change in designs. Brands such as Supreme and A Bathing Ape gained traction. About a decade later, streetwear became more mainstream as popular artists began showing off their sense of fashion. Now, mall companies are noticing the influx of streetwear demand and publishing their own ‘fast fashion’ to grab at the emerging market.
